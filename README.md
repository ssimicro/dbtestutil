# dbtestutil

Creates a self-destructing test database for use in test suites from one or more SQL files (e.g. schema + test corpus).
Includes several safety checks to prevent polluting production databases.

## Installation

    npm install --save-dev dbtestutil

## Requirements

The MySQL client binary `mysql` must be available.

## Rules of the Road

To use this module, your project must conform to the following standards in order to be a good citizen and minimize the chance of wrecking a production database:

* All databases must be fully described in schema files. They should go in the project's `db` directory.
 * the schema file MUST NOT include DROP IF nor REPLACE IF clauses. This prevents damage to existing databases if something goes wrong.
 * the schema file MUST NOT identify the database (no `CREATE DATABASE foo`, no `USE foo`, no `GRANT ALL ON foo TO ...`, etc).
 * a separate file can be created for creating the database and users, but it must not be processed by `dbtestutil`.
* All test suites SHOULD provide a `hostBlacklist` containing production hostnames and IPs.
* All test suites MUST provide a test database name. It SHOULD be unique (or have a high probability of being unique) and easily identifiable as a test database. Use `DbTestUtil.makeDatabaseName(projectName)` if you are unsure.
* All projects SHOULD default to test parameters and server configs.

The above conventions should keep you safe. This module tries to prevent database catastrophes in the following ways:

* The module will refuse to perform if the database name does not end in the magic suffix (which defaults to `_test`) to avoid clobbering active databases.
* The module will refuse to perform if the database host appears in the `hostBlacklist` to avoid running tests on production database servers. As mentioned above, it is highly recommended that a `hostBlacklist` be provided.
* The module will refuse to perform if the named database already exists to avoid clobbering an existing database.

## Configuration

There may be several developers working on several projects that utilize `dbtestutil`. Having each developer configure the database connection information
in each project can get tedious. To save some effort, `dbtestutil` will look for common configuration in a few places:

* `$HOME/.dbtestutil.conf`
* `/usr/local/etc/dbtestutil.conf`
* `/etc/dbtestutil.conf`

Developers can put their connection settings (username, password, host, etc) in a file in one of those locations and have those
settings used whereever `dbtestutil` is used. Those are JSON files containing any of the options applicable to the `connectionConfig`
object passed to `createTestDb()`.

## API

### new DbTestUtil(options)

Instantiates a new DbTestUtil instance.

The `options` parameter can contain any of the following (defaults listed below):

* `mysql`: name of `mysql` binary or path to `mysql` binary
* `databaseMustEndWith`: a suffix to look for so that we know for sure we didn't accidentally pass a production database name to this module.
* `hostBlacklist`: a list of hosts which are disallowed. Include all production database hostnames and IPs in here so that we don't accidentally point this module at the production database server.
* `charset`: the database's default character set.
* `collate`: the database's default collation table.

Here are the default values:

    {
        "mysql": "mysql",
        "databaseMustEndWith": "_test",
        "hostBlacklist": [],
        "charset": "utf8mb4",
        "collate": "utf8mb4_unicode_520_ci",
    }

### createTestDb(connectionConfig, sqlFiles, callback)

The `connectionConfig` parameter can contain any of the following (defaults listed below):

* `user`: a database username which corresponds to a user with database create and event create permissions.
* `password`: the `user`'s password.
* `socketPath`: socket file to use for connection. If set, the connection will happen via the socket and the `host` and `port` are ignored.
* `host`: hostname of the database server. Must not appear in `hostBlacklist`.
* `port`: TCP port for the database server.
* `database`: name of the database to create. Must not already exist. Must have expected suffix (`databaseMustEndWith`).
* `selfDestruct`: an ISO8601 duration indicating when the database should be automatically removed via the event scheduler. Set to `false` to preserve the database indefinitely.

Here are the default values:

    {
        "user": "root",
        "password": "",
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 3306,
        "database": "", // no default, must be supplied by caller
        "selfDestruct": "P1W"
    }

The `sqlFiles` parameter is an array of 0 or more SQL files to load into the database. Usually this will include a schema file and a test corpus.

The `callback` function accepts `(err)` which is either `null`/`undefined` OR an instance of `Error`. Here are some of the errors that one might see...

* `DBTESTUTIL_DATABASE_MISSING_SUFFIX` - the name of the database does not end with the `databaseMustEndWith` option passed to the constructor.
* `DBTESTUTIL_HOST_BLACKLISTED` - if `host` is present in the `hostBlacklist` option passed to the constructor.
* `DBTESTUTIL_DB_CREATE` - if there is a problem creating the database (auth/autz error, duplicate, etc).
* `DBTESTUTIL_EVENT_CREATE` - if there is a problem creating the self-destruct event.
* `DBTESTUTIL_MYSQL_CMD` - if there is a problem loading the SQL file(s).
* `DBTESTUTIL_PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT` - if the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to production; You probably don't want to run dbtestutil in that case.

### static makeDatabaseName(stem, suffix = "test", separator = "_")

Generates a database name like `foobar_3813f39a_test`.

## Example

```
const dbTestUtil = new DbTestUtil();
const connectionConfig = {
    database: DbTestUtil.makeDatabaseName('dbtestutil'),
};

dbTestUtil.createTestDb(connectionConfig, [
    path.join(__dirname, 'schema.sql'),
    path.join(__dirname, 'corpus.sql'),
], (err) => {
    if (err) {
        ...
    }
    const conn = mysql.createConnection(connectionConfig);

    ... use conn in test suite ...
});
```

## Testing

There is an automated test suite:

    npm test

Depending on your setup, you may need to create `test/db.conf`. This is a JSON file
which will contain the `connectionConfig` object (documented above) which is passed
to `createTestDb()`.
